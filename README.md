- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArthurFrancoiss
- 👀 I’m interested in Threat Intelligence and Information Gathering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Maltego Transforms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a local transform that matches images of people at different ages. The idea is to help people who lost their families when they were kids.
- 📫 I have a Medium blog related to this transform: https://medium.com/@arthur.francois. You can also send me an email at arthur.francois@hotmail.com or reach me out at https://github.com/ArthusFrancois
